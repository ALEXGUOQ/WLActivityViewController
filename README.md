WLActivityViewController
======================

WLActivityViewController is a UIActivityViewController subclass with title. It is useful for displaying information about the items to be shared, e.g., URL of a web page.

The initial design came from Tumblrâ€™s iOS app. It is later adopted by other popular apps like Tweetbot, Twitterrific and [Moke](http://moke.com/moke/).
